## Generative AI for Satellite Data Reconstruction

**The Problem**

Space-borne remote sensing enables continuous global observation, yet all satellite systems encounter sampling limitations to varying degrees. In satellite oceanography, it is standard practice to employ physics-based methodologies to address gaps in measurement data. Traditional approaches include simple optimal interpolation and more advanced data assimilation techniques that integrate primitive-equation numerical models. However, these methods have drawbacks: optimal interpolation relies on assumed a priori correlation functions, limiting its accuracy, while data assimilation is computationally intensive. AI-driven methodologies offer a promising solution, overcoming both the restrictive assumptions of interpolation and the computational burden of assimilation.
Example Projects
