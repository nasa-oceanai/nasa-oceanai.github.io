## Mission Statement

We are a collective of teams funded by NASA programs and friends and colleagues who are interested in advancing NASAâ€™s oceanography missions, sciences and applications. 

Our mission is to enhance and amplify NASA oceanography efforts by leveraging modern data science, including machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

This working group serves as a conduit to bridge disciplinary gaps, foster collaboration on existing projects, and initiate new endeavors.

## Working group objectives

* Advance the development of state-of-the-art machine learning tools designed for the analysis and synthesis of NASA's oceanography mission data.
* Transform ocean data analysis to address the big data challenges of modern remote sensing.
* Facilitate integration of multi-mission datasets, enabling real-time applications and supporting in-depth scientific exploration of causal relationships and future mission formulation.

## Approach
